Hi, my name is Caroline. I am a Frontend Developer based in Germany.
In the year 2022 I fell in love with webdevelopment and started my journey learning the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript while working full-time as a 
Physician in Training for Occupational Health.

The deeper I dove into webdevelopment I discovered JavaScript Frameworks and taught myself with the little help of the WorldWideWeb React.js.
Currently I am consolidate my JavaScript skills to become better in the whole development process. 
I am also curious grow as a developer and learn more about the backend and testing technologies.
